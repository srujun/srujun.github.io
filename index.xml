      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Srujun Thanmay Gupta, a software engineer at Google working on User Data and Privacy. Previously, I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign majoring in Computer Engineering. As an undergraduate student, I studied stream data processing systems with Prof. Indy and Shadi A. Noghabi, PhD.
This blog is an attempt to motivate me to write more. I want to post about things like my individual research work, projects, thoughts, and experiments.</description>
